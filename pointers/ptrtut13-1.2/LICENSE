Use of this Material:

Everything contained herein is hereby released to the Public Domain.
Any person may copy or distribute this material in any manner
they wish. The only thing I ask is that if this material is used
as a teaching aid in a class, I would appreciate it if it were
distributed in its entirety, i.e. including all chapters, the
preface and the introduction. I would also appreciate it if, under
such circumstances, the instructor of such a class would drop
me a note at one of the addresses below informing me of this.
I have written this with the hope that it will be useful to others
and since I'm not asking any financial remuneration, the only
way I know that I have at least partially reached that goal is
via feedback from those who find this material useful.</P> 

By the way, you needn't be an instructor or teacher to contact
me. I would appreciate a note from <U>anyone</U> who finds the
material useful, or who has constructive criticism to offer. I'm
also willing to answer questions submitted by email at the addresses
shown below.
